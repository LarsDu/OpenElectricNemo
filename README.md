# OpenElectricNemo
The open-sourced portion of an experimental rudimentary game made using Kivy/Kivent. This is a simple example of how to construct a game in Python using Entity-Component-System (ECS) priciples.

This requires both [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) and [Kivent](https://github.com/kivy/kivent)
to be installed. (Note: that as of 2018, Kivent may require Cython 0.23 for installation, whereas Kivy should be compatible with more recent versions of Cython).

I have also included a custom Cython renderer (SfxRenderer) under modules which I am using in the actual commercial version of this game, but this is not actually used by the demo game I have included in this repository.

Hit space to shoot missiles and mouse-1 to jump up. 

I've blotched out the main ship sprite on purpose for future copyright reasons
